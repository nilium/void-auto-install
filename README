void-auto-install
=================

void-auto-install is an experimental implementation of the void-mklive
auto-install script, except in Go. The eventual goal is to break down
all stages of installation as units of configuration and, ideally, allow
more, such as user/group creation, service configuration, and other
elements of provisioning that I would like to have on my servers.

This is not a necessary project and primarily exists to see what can be
done. Current users of Void can already accomplish most of this with an
end script through the installer.
